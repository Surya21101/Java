You’ve probably heard of Lorem Ipsum before – 
it’s the most-used dummy text excerpt out there.
 People use it because it has a fairly normal distribution
 of letters and words (making it look like normal English),
 but it’s also Latin, which means your average reader won’t
 get distracted by trying to read it.
